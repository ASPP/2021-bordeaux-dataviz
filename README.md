# Best practices in data visualization

## Notebooks

### Introduction

> In this introduction, we'll see how to make a figure and play with the
> different settings such as to improve the rendering. We'll also see
> how to compose a figure made of several subplots with a moderatly
> complex layout.

### Catalogue

> In this lesson, we'll review the many different types of plot
> matplotlib offers and manipulate them, namely, plot, scatter, imshow
> and bar plots.

### Scales & projections

> Matplotlib offers the possibility to use different scales (log
> scale, symlog scale, logit scale) and projections (polar, 3D,
> geographic). We'll review a few of them in this lesson.

### Animation

>  Animation with matplotlib can be created very easily using the
>  animation framework. During this lesson, we'll show how to create
>  an animation and save it as a movie.
